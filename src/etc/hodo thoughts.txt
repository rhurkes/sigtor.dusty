Bunkers is best, 15R85 is second best, mean-wind middle, and 30R75 is garbage.

The 30R75
algorithm was, by far, the poorest predictor of
storm speeds across the entire supercell
database. Notably, 30R75 was too slow for
nearly 75% of tornadic storms, and its even
poorer performance for nontornadic storms
placed its inner quartiles below zero for ths
supercell data set as a whole.

Suggests improving Bunkers by using 0-8km wind layer instead of 0-6km
HP supercells and bow echoes have large forecast errors
